APIs (I was going to look into using Swagger for this, however it seemed overkill for the task):

/booking                                         -POST, add a new booking

{
  seatId: number,
  filmId: number
}

cinemas/                                        -GET, get all cinemas

{
  cinemaId: string
  address: string
  name: string
}

cinemas/id                                      -GET, get theatres in a cinema
[{
  cinemaId:
  ScreenName:
}]

/films      /                                  -GET, gets all films
            /id                                -GET, gets film details

{
  name: string
  description: string
  image: string
  theatreId: number
}

/films/{filmId}/theatre/{theatreId}/seats     -GET, gets seats for a film and the booked status
{
  available: boolean,
